question="I don't want to join channels manually - Is Smuxi able to remember which channels I like to join?"
answer="""
Yes, you can tell Smuxi several channels you want to join when connecting to a
server.

From the menu go to Server --> Manage

Choose the server, to which you want to add the channel and click on edit.
In the _On Connect Commands_ text box at the bottom of the window you may enter the channels you want
to join like the following:

    /join #smuxi,#smuxi.de,#debian,#ubuntu

This way you will join the 4 channels mentioned above.
