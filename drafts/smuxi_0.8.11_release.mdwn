Notable highlights in this release are:

### Enhanced User Interface ###

 * The /exec command is now supported, so now you can execute commands right
   from Smuxi. (/exec -c #276, /exec -o #277)
 * Size matters: The entry grows and shrinks automatically or manually, and the
   topic bar changes size too. Say goodbye to pointless scrollbars! (entry #831
   , Oliver Schneider)
 * Little things: New tab completion cycling, (Ondřej Hošek) reconnect menu
   entry in a server tab context menu, search from the person list, (#567)
