This tarbal contains only the source code of Smuxi and is intended for package
maintainers and advanced users of Unix-like operating systems as it requires you
to compile Smuxi and the needed components yourself.

These libraries have to be installed before you can compile and install Smuxi:

 * [Mono][] >= 2.6
 * [log4net][]
 * [Nini][] >= 1.1
 * [GTK#][] >= 2.8 (optional)

After you have installed those you can configure and build the Smuxi source
using:

    ./configure
    make

After the compile finished you can install Smuxi by running the following
command as root:

    make install

Now you can start Smuxi from the GNOME or KDE menu.
