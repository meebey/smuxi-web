### Static server binary: [smuxi-server-1.0.5-linux-x86_64-static.tar.gz][] ([.asc][server-sig]) ###

This tarball contains a statically linked smuxi-server binary for the x86_64 /
AMD64 architecture. This binary is self-contained and does not need any external
libraries or runtime like Mono. This binary is very useful for shell / VPS
systems where you can't install system software.

### Source: [smuxi-1.0.8.tar.gz][] ([.asc][]) ###

This tarbal contains only the source code of Smuxi and is intended for package
maintainers and advanced users of Unix-like operating systems as it requires you
to compile Smuxi and the needed components yourself.

These libraries have to be installed before you can compile and install Smuxi:

 * [Mono][] >= 2.6
 * [log4net][]
 * [Nini][] >= 1.1
 * [GTK#][] >= 2.8 (optional)

After you have installed those you can configure and build the Smuxi source
using:

    ./configure
    make

After the compile finished you can install Smuxi by running the following
command as root:

    make install

Now you can start Smuxi from the GNOME or KDE menu.
