# About #

Smuxi is an open-source, powerful, flexible, and user-friendly chat client
created by [Mirco Bauer][meebey] and developed by other contributors. Inspired
by the combination of [screen][] and [irssi][], Smuxi has a detachable server
(or like a "normal" client) that stays connected when you aren't, and can allow
multiple Smuxi frontends (like the GNOME frontend, or STFL text-based frontend)
to be connected and in sync. This is similar to screen+irssi or IRC bouncers,
but more elegant and powerful.

## History ##

Smuxi was created in 2004 when [Mirco Bauer][meebey] could not find a client
quite like irssi running in a screen session. Although this was ideal for
leaving connected, it didn't integrate with the desktop well. Smuxi was
developed to fit this need, with irssi being a major influence into the way it
behaves.

## Technology ##

Smuxi is powered by C# and Mono. The libraries used include SmartIrc4net,
Newtonsoft.Json, ServiceStack, Twitterizer, Jabber-Net, STFL, GTK#, and many
more.
